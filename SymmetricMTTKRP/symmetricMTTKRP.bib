abstract = {Communication lower bounds have long been established for matrix multiplication algorithms. However, most methods of asymptotic analysis have either ignored constant factors or not obtained the tightest possible values. The main result of this work is establishing memory-independent communication lower bounds with tight constants for parallel matrix multiplication. Our constants improve on previous work in each of three cases that depend on the relative sizes of the matrix aspect ratios and the number of processors.},
