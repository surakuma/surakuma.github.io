We are very much thankful to the experts for reviewing our proposal. We would like to comment on some remarks.

From evaluation 220988:

Remark 1: The project is too limited from the point of view of the algorithms to be parallelized for the use of tensor computations.

We focus on developing parallel provable algorithms for two fundamental tensor computations, CP and Tucker decompostions. An important and novel aspect of this project is to study both tensor decompositions on heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, the project includes setting up a public repository to store dense tensors, all the tensors of real applications on which we plan to evaluate our algorithms (see Section 1.7). It will help other researchers to use them as a benchmark.


Remark 2: The scientific objectives of this project remain very close to the work done by the PI during his postdoc at Inria Paris.

This project is based on the PI's work on Multi-TTM during his postdoc. We mention the findings in terms of preliminary results in Figures 2 & 3. The results encourage us to study how to perform Multi-TTM and MTTKRP such that the communication costs are optimal. As mentioned earlier, a novel aspect is to study both CP and Tucker decompositions on heterogeneous systems.

Remark 3: Potential tensor applications of the designed algorithms are not clearly identified.

This is a fundamental research addressing the basic operations that are used in popular tensor computations. While many applications will benefit from the outcomes immensely, we are not there yet. The project's duration and resources are not adequate for either extending the scope of the project with an impactful application or involving another party outside the hosting institute. We will certainly build expertise towards the end of the project with the help of the planned Subtask A4.2 to identify impactful applications.

Remark 1: Task B focuses on the design of optimal algorithms for heterogeneous systems, which is a simple extension of task A (which deals with homogeneous systems).

Designing provable algorithms for heterogeneous systems is challenging. To provide a context, there is still not any communication optimal matrix multiplication (one of the simplest linear algebra computation) algorithm for heterogeneous systems. This project is a small step in the direction of proposing a general framework for heterogeneous systems and we will focus on two fundamental tensor decompositions.

Remark 2: The project assumes that an (efficient) parallel implementation of the classical HOSVD truncation approach will perform better than the sequentially truncated approach.

We provide arguments for this hypothesis in the last paragraph of Page 4. Our hypothesis is also validated by a recent work (https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1540363).

Remark 3: To compute CP decomposition, typically we first perform a HOSVD (or STHOSVD) in order to reduce the dimensions of the tensor [R2]. This weakens the practical interest of a parallel algorithm for MTTKRP.

The approach proposed in [R2] has not been validated on real world tensors yet (to our knowledge). It has also not been studied whether providing the output of this approach to CP-ALS algorithm, which performs MTTKRPs, would improve the approximation or not. We feel this approach is interesting but requires more studies and validations for wider adoption.

Remark 4: It is not entirely clear to what extent the proposed program represents an important methodological advance breaking with the state of the art, especially for task A.

We plan to analyze all possible ways to perform Multi-TTM and MTTKRP such that their completion times are optimal (see Section 1.3).

Remark 5: This proposal lacks a bit of openness towards other similar problems that employ MTTKRP.

The designed algorithms and their implementations can be employed for other similar tensor problems.

Remark 6: How the proposed approach of [R1] relates to this work?

We focus on the design of provable parallel algorithms for a popular CP decomposition method. The approach proposed in [R1] performs several CP decompositions of small tensors in parallel and then combines them. The adoption of this approach seems limited. We will compare our results with it.

Remark 7: How to evaluate optimality of the designed algorithms is not very clear?

While designing algorithms in WPA3, WPB3 and WPB4, we will evaluate how far the overall completion cost of an algorithm is from the maximum of communication lower bound and minimum computation cost.

Remark 8: We note a greater relative involvement of the PI in task B compared to task A.

Yes, the PI is more involved in task B (work proposed for the postdoc). As there is limited work on communication costs for heterogeneous machines. The PI plans to spend a good amount of time during the beginning of task B to design a general framework to determine communication lower bounds for heterogeneous machines.
